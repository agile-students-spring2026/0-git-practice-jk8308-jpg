## Reflection
What I found most interesting about this article is how it shows the role of software engineers shifting from writing code line by line to directing AI-generated code. The idea that engineers at companies like OpenAI and Anthropic may rely on AI for all of their code really surprised me. Instead of focusing on syntax and implementation details, developers are increasingly focused on problem formulation, reviewing outputs, and making high-level architectural decisions. This suggests that understanding how systems work may become more important than manually producing code.

I also found it interesting that such trend does not eliminate the need for human software engineers, but it would changes their responsibilities. The article implies that human judgment and decision-making are still essential. This shift raises important questions about how future developers like me should be trained and what skills will matter most.

### Comment from Lily Luo

> I found your reflection **very insightful**, especially your discussion of how engineers are shifting toward **guiding AI-generated code** rather than writing everything manually. Comparing this to the article I read about technology in the 2026 Winter Olympics made me appreciate how software engineering increasingly focuses on **system design, reliability, and decision-making** across many different fields.
